# Snake-Water-Gun-Game
Welcome to the Snake Water Gun Game! This is a user-friendly and responsive web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Inspired by the classic rock-paper-scissors game, it replaces the traditional options with snake, water, and gun.  
This project was created to exercise and improve my web development skills.  
It features an intuitive interface and engaging gameplay, providing an interactive and fun experience.  
Enjoy playing and feel free to explore the code to see how it all works!
